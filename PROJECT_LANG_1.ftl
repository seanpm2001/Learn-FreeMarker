<p>Project language file 1</p>
<p>For: seanpm2001/Learn-FreeMarker</p>
<p>About:</p>
<p>I decided to make FreeMarker the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-FreeMarker) as FreeMarker is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the FreeMarker programming language. It only makes sense to FreeMarker the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.</p>
